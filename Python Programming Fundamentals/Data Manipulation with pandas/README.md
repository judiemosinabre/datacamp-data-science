# Course Outline
pandas is the world's most popular Python library, used for everything from data manipulation to data analysis. In this course, we'll learn how to manipulate DataFrames, as we extract, filter, and transform real-world datasets for analysis. Using pandas we’ll explore all the core data science concepts. Using real-world data, including Walmart sales figures and global temperature time series, we’ll learn how to import, clean, calculate statistics, and create visualizations—using pandas to add to the power of Python!
