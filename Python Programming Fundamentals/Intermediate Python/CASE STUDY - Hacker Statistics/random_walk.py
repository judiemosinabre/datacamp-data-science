'''
Before, you have already written Python code that 
determines the next step based on the previous step. 
Now it's time to put this code inside a for loop so 
that we can simulate a random walk.
'''
import numpy as np

# NumPy is imported, seed is set

# Initialize random_walk
random_walk = [0]

# Complete the ___
for x in range(100) :
    # Set step: last element in random_walk
    step = random_walk[-1]

    # Roll the dice
    dice = np.random.randint(1,7)

    # Determine next step
    if dice <= 2:
        step = step - 1
    elif dice <= 5:
        step = step + 1
    else:
        step = step + np.random.randint(1,7)

    # append next_step to random_walk
    random_walk.append(step)

# Print random_walk
print(random_walk)
