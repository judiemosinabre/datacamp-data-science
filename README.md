# Datacamp Data Science
I am proud to be a **DataCamp Scholar**, and I will not take this opportunity for granted. 
With the resources provided, Iâ€™m committed to making the most of this learning journey.

Becoming an **AI Engineer** has always been a personal goal of mine. 
Iâ€™m deeply passionate about exploring data, uncovering patterns, and building intelligent systems that solve real-world problems. 
Whether itâ€™s through **machine learning, computer vision, or natural language processing**, 
Iâ€™m excited by the possibilities of AI and its power to drive innovation.

Despite juggling school, work, and self-study, I remain committed to upskilling. 
I believe that learning should be a **lifelong journey** and this repo is a reflection of that mindset.
